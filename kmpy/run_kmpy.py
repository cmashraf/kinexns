"""
Build and solve the ligpy kinetic model.  This model simulates the
pyrolysis of lignin in a perfectly mixed batch reactor.  For complete model
details see the journal article linked in the README at
https://github.com/houghb/ligpy.
Please read the documentation for instructions on using this module.
